HypeOrNah
=========

HypeOrNah is a venue rating app targeted at college campuses and city life. It uses crowd-sourced data to generate real-time ratings that help users ascertain the current atmosphere at venues such as bars, clubs and Greek fraternities based on their current location. These ratings are compiled by users actually present at the location who vote whether it is “hype” or “nah” and post pictures, videos, and comments. The content is refreshed on a daily basis to ensure that users get the latest information. 

HypeOrNah was built using the Ionic framework built on top of AngularJS. It is compatible on all browsers and mobile devices.
